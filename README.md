# Node Weather App

Simple weather app built in NodeJS using [MapBox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/).
Based on location input, the app will return the current temperature, expected high and low temperature that day and the % chance for precipitation.

App currently deployed on Heroku here --> [https://gaber-weather-application.herokuapp.com/](https://gaber-weather-application.herokuapp.com/)
